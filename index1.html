    <h1>Lyrics to the Melody of a Pacified Storm</h1>
    <h3>Author: Su Shi</h3>
    <p>
        Heed not to the tree-rustling and leaf-lashing rain,<br>
        Why not stroll along, whistle and sing under its rein.<br>
        Lighter and better suited than horses are straw sandals and a bamboo staff,<br>
        Who's afraid?<br>
        A palm-leaf plaited cape provides enough to misty weather in life sustain.<br>
        A thorny spring breeze sobers up the spirit,<br>
        I feel a slight chill,<br>
        The setting sun over the mountain offers greetings still.<br>
        Looking back over the bleak passage survived,<br>
        The return in time<br>
        Shall not be affected by windswept rain or shine.
